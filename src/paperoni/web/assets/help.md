Welcome to Paperoni! Paperoni is a tool for paper management.

# Search {: #search}

The search interface allows searching through Paperoni's database of papers. It will search as you type. Results are sorted so that the most recent publications appear on top.

* **Title**: Search by paper title.
* **Author**: Search by author. It is currently not possible to search for multiple authors, nor by author affiliation. We will likely add this functionality in the future.
* **Venue**: Search by venue. Venue aliases are not properly taken into account yet, which means that you may need to search for "Neural Information Processing Systems" instead of "NeurIPS" or vice versa.
* **Start/end date**: Search for a paper that had any release between the start and end date. For example, an article with a preprint in 2022 and a publication in 2023 will appear both in 2022 and in 2023.
* **Validated/Invalidated/Not processed/All**: Only select papers that were manually validated/not yet validated or invalidated/all papers regardless of validation.

## Exporting search results

Search results can be downloaded as JSON or CSV files. Simply click on the "JSON" or "CSV" button. CSV files can be [imported in Google Sheets](https://blog.golayer.io/google-sheets/import-csv-to-google-sheets) or in Excel.

# Validation {: #validation}

The validation interface allows the validation or invalidation of papers, in order to make the database cleaner.

# Editing papers {: #edit}

The edition interface lets you change all data associated to papers.

Note that the validation interface sets/unsets the valid/invalid flags, so it is possible to do it within the validation interface, it is just less straightforward.
