  paper:
    abstract: In Bayesian structure learning, we are interested in inferring a distribution
      over the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure of Bayesian networks, from data.
      Defining such a distribution is very challenging, due to the combinatorially
      large sample space, and approximations based on MCMC are often required. Recently,
      a novel class of probabilistic models, called Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets),
      have been introduced as a general framework for generative modeling of discrete
      and composite objects, such as graphs. In this work, we propose to use a GFlowNet
      as an alternative to MCMC for approximating the posterior distribution over
      the structure of Bayesian networks, given a dataset of observations. Generating
      a sample DAG from this approximate distribution is viewed as a sequential decision
      problem, where the graph is constructed one edge at a time, based on learned
      transition probabilities. Through evaluation on both simulated and real data,
      we show that our approach, called DAG-GFlowNet, provides an accurate approximation
      of the posterior over DAGs, and it compares favorably against other methods
      based on MCMC or variational inference.

  paper:
    abstract: In reinforcement learning, the graph Laplacian has proved to be a valuable
      tool in the task-agnostic setting, with applications ranging from skill discovery
      to reward shaping. Recently, learning the Laplacian representation has been
      framed as the optimization of a temporally-contrastive objective to overcome
      its computational limitations in large (or continuous) state spaces. However,
      this approach requires uniform access to all states in the state space, overlooking
      the exploration problem that emerges during the representation learning process.
      In this work, we propose an alternative method that is able to recover, in a
      non-uniform-prior setting, the expressiveness and the desired properties of
      the Laplacian representation. We do so by combining the representation learning
      with a skill-based covering policy, which provides a better training distribution
      to extend and refine the representation. We also show that a simple augmentation
      of the representation objective with the learned temporal abstractions improves
      dynamics-awareness and helps exploration. We find that our method succeeds as
      an alternative to the Laplacian in the non-uniform setting and scales to challenging
      continuous control environments. Finally, even if our method is not optimized
      for skill discovery, the learned skills can successfully solve difficult continuous
      navigation tasks with sparse rewards, where standard skill discovery approaches
      are no so effective.
