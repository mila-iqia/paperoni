  paper:
    abstract: 'Diffusion models have emerged as effective distribution estimators
      in vision, language, and reinforcement learning, but their use as priors in
      downstream tasks poses an intractable posterior inference problem. This paper
      studies *amortized* sampling of the posterior over data, $\mathbf{x}\sim p^{\rm
      post}(\mathbf{x})\propto p(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x})$, in a model that consists
      of a diffusion generative model prior $p(\mathbf{x})$ and a black-box constraint
      or likelihood function $r(\mathbf{x})$. We state and prove the asymptotic correctness
      of a data-free learning objective, *relative trajectory balance*, for training
      a diffusion model that samples from this posterior, a problem that existing
      methods solve only approximately or in restricted cases. Relative trajectory
      balance arises from the generative flow network perspective on diffusion models,
      which allows the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques to improve mode
      coverage. Experiments illustrate the broad potential of unbiased inference of
      arbitrary posteriors under diffusion priors: in vision (classifier guidance),
      language (infilling under a discrete diffusion LLM), and multimodal data (text-to-image
      generation). Beyond generative modeling, we apply relative trajectory balance
      to the problem of continuous control with a score-based behavior prior, achieving
      state-of-the-art results on benchmarks in offline reinforcement learning. Code
