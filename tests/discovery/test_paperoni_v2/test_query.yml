- abstract: 'Recent advances in attention-free sequence models rely on convolutions
    as alternatives to the attention operator at the core of Transformers. In particular,
    long convolution sequence models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
    many domains, but incur a significant cost during auto-regressive inference workloads
    -- naively requiring a full pass (or caching of activations) over the input sequence
    for each generated token -- similarly to attention-based models. In this paper,
    we seek to enable $\mathcal O(1)$ compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained
    long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput
    during generation. Concretely, our methods consist in extracting low-dimensional
    linear state-space models from each convolution layer, building upon rational
    interpolation and model-order reduction techniques. We further introduce architectural
    improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena: by weight-tying the filters
    across channels into heads, we achieve higher pre-training quality and reduce
    the number of filters to be distilled. The resulting model achieves 10x higher
    throughput than Transformers and 1.5x higher than Hyena at 1.3B parameters, without
    any loss in quality after distillation.'
