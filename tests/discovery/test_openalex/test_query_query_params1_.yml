- abstract: Sequential data often possesses hierarchical structures with complex dependencies
    between sub-sequences, such as found between the utterances in a dialogue. To
    model these dependencies in a generative framework, we propose a neural network-based
    generative architecture, with stochastic latent variables that span a variable
    number of time steps. We apply the proposed model to the task of dialogue response
    generation and compare it with other recent neural-network architectures. We evaluate
    the model performance through a human evaluation study. The experiments demonstrate
    that our model improves upon recently proposed models and that the latent variables
    facilitate both the generation of meaningful, long and diverse responses and maintaining
    dialogue state.

- abstract: We present in this paper a novel approach for training deterministic auto-encoders.
    We show that by adding a well chosen penalty term to the classical reconstruction
    cost function, we can achieve results that equal or surpass those attained by
    other regularized autoencoders as well as denoising auto-encoders on a range of
    datasets. This penalty term corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian
    matrix of the encoder activations with respect to the input. We show that this
    penalty term results in a localized space contraction which in turn yields robust
    features on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is
    related to both regularized auto-encoders and denoising auto-encoders and how
    it can be seen as a link between deterministic and non-deterministic auto-encoders.
    We find empirically that this penalty helps to carve a representation that better
    captures the local directions of variation dictated by the data, corresponding
    to a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while being more invariant to the
    vast majority of directions orthogonal to the manifold. Finally, we show that
    by using the learned features to initialize a MLP, we achieve state of the art
    classification error on a range of datasets, surpassing other methods of pretraining.

- abstract: 'If we take an existing supervised NLP system, a simple and general way
    to improve accuracy is to use unsupervised word representations as extra word
    features. We evaluate Brown clusters, Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings,
    and HLBL (Mnih &amp;amp; Hinton, 2009) embeddings of words on both NER and chunking.
    We use near state-of-the-art supervised baselines, and find that each of the three
    word representations improves the accuracy of these baselines. We find further
    improvements by combining different word representations. You can download our
    word features, for off-the-shelf use in existing NLP systems, as well as our code,

- abstract: We introduce the problem of zero-data learning, where a model must generalize
    to classes or tasks for which no training data are available and only a description
    of the classes or tasks are provided. Zero-data learning is useful for problems
    where the set of classes to distinguish or tasks to solve is very large and is
    not entirely covered by the training data. The main contributions of this work
    lie in the presentation of a general formalization of zero-data learning, in an
    experimental analysis of its properties and in empirical evidence showing that
    generalization is possible and significant in this context. The experimental work
    of this paper addresses two classification problems of character recognition and
    a multitask ranking problem in the context of drug discovery. Finally, we conclude
    by discussing how this new framework could lead to a novel perspective on how
    to extend machine learning towards AI, where an agent can be given a specification
    for a learning problem before attempting to solve it (with very few or even zero
    examples).
