- abstract: Sequential data often possesses hierarchical structures with complex dependencies
    between sub-sequences, such as found between the utterances in a dialogue. To
    model these dependencies in a generative framework, we propose a neural network-based
    generative architecture, with stochastic latent variables that span a variable
    number of time steps. We apply the proposed model to the task of dialogue response
    generation and compare it with other recent neural-network architectures. We evaluate
    the model performance through a human evaluation study. The experiments demonstrate
    that our model improves upon recently proposed models and that the latent variables
    facilitate both the generation of meaningful, long and diverse responses and maintaining
    dialogue state.
