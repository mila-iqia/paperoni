  paper:
    abstract: Sequential data often possesses hierarchical structures with complex
      dependencies between sub-sequences, such as found between the utterances in
      a dialogue. To model these dependencies in a generative framework, we propose
      a neural network-based generative architecture, with stochastic latent variables
      that span a variable number of time steps. We apply the proposed model to the
      task of dialogue response generation and compare it with other recent neural-network
      architectures. We evaluate the model performance through a human evaluation
      study. The experiments demonstrate that our model improves upon recently proposed
      models and that the latent variables facilitate both the generation of meaningful,
      long and diverse responses and maintaining dialogue state.

  paper:
    abstract: We examine the role of memorization in deep learning, drawing connections
      to capacity, generalization, and adversarial robustness. While deep networks
      are capable of memorizing noise data, our results suggest that they tend to
      prioritize learning simple patterns first. In our experiments, we expose qualitative
      differences in gradient-based optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) on
      noise vs. real data. We also demonstrate that for appropriately tuned explicit
      regularization (e.g., dropout) we can degrade DNN training performance on noise
      datasets without compromising generalization on real data. Our analysis suggests
      that the notions of effective capacity which are dataset independent are unlikely
      to explain the generalization performance of deep networks when trained with
      gradient based methods because training data itself plays an important role
      in determining the degree of memorization.

  paper:
    abstract: We introduce a method to train Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) - neural
      networks with binary weights and activations at run-time. At train-time the
      binary weights and activations are used for computing the parameter gradients.
      During the forward pass, BNNs drastically reduce memory size and accesses, and
      replace most arithmetic operations with bit-wise operations, which is expected
      to substantially improve power-efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of
      BNNs, we conducted two sets of experiments on the Torch7 and Theano frameworks.
      On both, BNNs achieved nearly state-of-the-art results over the MNIST, CIFAR-10
      and SVHN datasets. We also report our preliminary results on the challenging
      ImageNet dataset. Last but not least, we wrote a binary matrix multiplication
      GPU kernel with which it is possible to run our MNIST BNN 7 times faster than
      with an unoptimized GPU kernel, without suffering any loss in classification
      accuracy. The code for training and running our BNNs is available on-line.

  paper:
    abstract: We investigate the task of building open domain, conversational dialogue
      systems based on large dialogue corpora using generative models. Generative
      models produce system responses that are autonomously generated word-by-word,
      opening up the possibility for realistic, flexible interactions. In support
      of this goal, we extend the recently proposed hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder
      neural network to the dialogue domain, and demonstrate that this model is competitive
      with state-of-the-art neural language models and back-off n-gram models. We
      investigate the limitations of this and similar approaches, and show how its
      performance can be improved by bootstrapping the learning from a larger question-answer
      pair corpus and from pretrained word embeddings.

  paper:
    abstract: We present in this paper a novel approach for training deterministic
      auto-encoders. We show that by adding a well chosen penalty term to the classical
      reconstruction cost function, we can achieve results that equal or surpass those
      attained by other regularized auto-encoders as well as denoising auto-encoders
      on a range of datasets. This penalty term corresponds to the Frobenius norm
      of the Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations with respect to the input.
      We show that this penalty term results in a localized space contraction which
      in turn yields robust features on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show
      how this penalty term is related to both regularized auto-encoders and denoising
      auto-encoders and how it can be seen as a link between deterministic and non-deterministic
      auto-encoders. We find empirically that this penalty helps to carve a representation
      that better captures the local directions of variation dictated by the data,
      corresponding to a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while being more invariant
      to the vast majority of directions orthogonal to the manifold. Finally, we show
      that by using the learned features to initialize a MLP, we achieve state of
      the art classification error on a range of datasets, surpassing other methods
      of pretraining.
