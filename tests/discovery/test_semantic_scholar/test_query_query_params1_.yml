  paper:
    abstract: Building intelligent agents to generate realistic Weibo comments is
      challenging. For such realistic Weibo comments, the key criterion is improving
      diversity while maintaining coherency. Considering that the variability of linguistic
      comments arises from multi-level sources, including both discourse-level properties
      and word-level selections, we improve the comment diversity by leveraging such
      inherent hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a structured latent variable recurrent
      network, which exploits the hierarchical-structured latent variables with stochastic
      attention to model the variations of comments. First, we endow both discourse-level
      and word-level latent variables with hierarchical and temporal dependencies
      for constructing multi-level hierarchy. Second, we introduce a stochastic attention
      to infer the key-words of interest in the input post. As a result, diverse comments
      can be generated with both discourse-level properties and local-word selections.
      Experiments on open-domain Weibo data show that our model generates more diverse
      and realistic comments.
