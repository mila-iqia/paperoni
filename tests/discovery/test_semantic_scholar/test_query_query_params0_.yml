- abstract: 'Learning in nonstationary environments is one of the biggest challenges
    in machine learning. Nonstationarity can be caused by either task drift, i.e.,
    the drift in the conditional distribution of labels given the input data, or the
    domain drift, i.e., the drift in the marginal distribution of the input data.
    This article aims to tackle this challenge with a modularized two-stream continual
    learning (CL) system, where the model is required to learn new tasks from a support
    stream and adapted to new domains in the query stream while maintaining previously
    learned knowledge. To deal with both drifts within and across the two streams,
    we propose a variational domain-agnostic feature replay-based approach that decouples
    the system into three modules: an inference module that filters the input data
    from the two streams into domain-agnostic representations, a generative module
    that facilitates the high-level knowledge transfer, and a solver module that applies
    the filtered and transferable knowledge to solve the queries. We demonstrate the
    effectiveness of our proposed approach in addressing the two fundamental scenarios
    and complex scenarios in two-stream CL.'

  title: A Two-Stream Continual Learning System With Variational Domain-Agnostic Feature
    Replay

- abstract: The COVID‐19 pandemic continues to pose a substantial threat to human
    lives and is likely to do so for years to come. Despite the availability of vaccines,
    searching for efficient small‐molecule drugs that are widely available, including
    in low‐ and middle‐income countries, is an ongoing challenge. In this work, we
    report the results of an open science community effort, the “Billion molecules
    against COVID‐19 challenge”, to identify small‐molecule inhibitors against SARS‐CoV‐2
    or relevant human receptors. Participating teams used a wide variety of computational
    methods to screen a minimum of 1 billion virtual molecules against 6 protein targets.
    Overall, 31 teams participated, and they suggested a total of 639,024 molecules,
    which were subsequently ranked to find ‘consensus compounds’. The organizing team
    coordinated with various contract research organizations (CROs) and collaborating
    institutions to synthesize and test 878 compounds for biological activity against
    proteases (Nsp5, Nsp3, TMPRSS2), nucleocapsid N, RdRP (only the Nsp12 domain),
    and (alpha) spike protein S. Overall, 27 compounds with weak inhibition/binding
    were experimentally identified by binding‐, cleavage‐, and/or viral suppression
    assays and are presented here. Open science approaches such as the one presented
    here contribute to the knowledge base of future drug discovery efforts in finding
    better SARS‐CoV‐2 treatments.

  title: A hybrid coder for hidden Markov models using a recurrent neural networks
  topics:
  - name: Computer Science
- abstract: One of the most fundamental laws of physics is the principle of least
    action. Motivated by its predictive power, we introduce a neuronal least-action
    principle for cortical processing of sensory streams to produce appropriate behavioural
    outputs in real time. The principle postulates that the voltage dynamics of cortical
    pyramidal neurons prospectively minimizes the local somato-dendritic mismatch
    error within individual neurons. For output neurons, the principle implies minimizing
    an instantaneous behavioural error. For deep network neurons, it implies the prospective
    firing to overcome integration delays and correct for possible output errors right
    in time. The neuron-specific errors are extracted in the apical dendrites of pyramidal
    neurons through a cortical microcircuit that tries to explain away the feedback
    from the periphery, and correct the trajectory on the fly. Any motor output is
    in a moving equilibrium with the sensory input and the motor feedback during the
    ongoing sensory-motor transform. Online synaptic plasticity reduces the somato-dendritic
    mismatch error within each cortical neuron and performs gradient descent on the
    output cost at any moment in time. The neuronal least-action principle offers
    an axiomatic framework to derive local neuronal and synaptic laws for global real-time
    computation and learning in the brain.

  title: A neuronal least-action principle for real-time learning in cortical circuits
  topics:
  - name: Biology
  - name: Medicine
- abstract: Abstract:Since OpenAI's release of the very large language models Chat-GPT
    and GPT-4, the potential dangers of AI have garnered widespread public attention.
    In this essay, the author reviews the threats to democracy posed by the possibility
    of "rogue AIs," dangerous and powerful AIs that would execute harmful goals, irrespective
    of whether the outcomes are intended by humans. To mitigate against the risk that
    rogue AIs present to democracy and geopolitical stability, the author argues that
    research into safe and defensive AIs should be conducted by a multilateral, international
    network of research laboratories.
