- abstract: 'Diffusion models have emerged as effective distribution estimators in
    vision, language, and reinforcement learning, but their use as priors in downstream
    tasks poses an intractable posterior inference problem. This paper studies *amortized*
    sampling of the posterior over data, $\mathbf{x}\sim p^{\rm post}(\mathbf{x})\propto
    p(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x})$, in a model that consists of a diffusion generative
    model prior $p(\mathbf{x})$ and a black-box constraint or likelihood function
    $r(\mathbf{x})$. We state and prove the asymptotic correctness of a data-free
    learning objective, *relative trajectory balance*, for training a diffusion model
    that samples from this posterior, a problem that existing methods solve only approximately
    or in restricted cases. Relative trajectory balance arises from the generative
    flow network perspective on diffusion models, which allows the use of deep reinforcement
    learning techniques to improve mode coverage. Experiments illustrate the broad
    potential of unbiased inference of arbitrary posteriors under diffusion priors:
    in vision (classifier guidance), language (infilling under a discrete diffusion
    LLM), and multimodal data (text-to-image generation). Beyond generative modeling,
    we apply relative trajectory balance to the problem of continuous control with
    a score-based behavior prior, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks
    in offline reinforcement learning. Code is available at [this link](https://github.com/GFNOrg/diffusion-finetuning).'

  title: Amortizing intractable inference in diffusion models for vision, language,
    and control
  topics:
  - name: Generative Models->Diffusion models
- abstract: We study the problem of training diffusion models to sample from a distribution
    with a given unnormalized density or energy function. We benchmark several diffusion-structured
    inference methods, including simulation-based variational approaches and off-policy
    methods (continuous generative flow networks). Our results shed light on the relative
    advantages of existing algorithms while bringing into question some claims from
    past work. We also propose a novel exploration strategy for off-policy methods,
    based on local search in the target space with the use of a replay buffer, and
    show that it improves the quality of samples on a variety of target distributions.
    Our code for the sampling methods and benchmarks studied is made public at [this
    link](https://github.com/GFNOrg/gfn-diffusion) as a base for future work on diffusion
    models for amortized inference.

  title: Improved off-policy training of diffusion samplers
  topics:
  - name: Generative Models->Diffusion models
- abstract: \emph{Metacognitive knowledge} refers to humans' intuitive knowledge of
    their own thinking and reasoning processes. Today's best LLMs clearly possess
    some reasoning processes. The paper gives evidence that they also  have metacognitive
    knowledge, including ability to name skills and procedures to apply given a task.
    We explore this primarily in context of math reasoning, developing a prompt-guided
    interaction procedure  to get a powerful  LLM to assign sensible skill labels
    to math questions, followed by having it perform semantic clustering to obtain
    coarser families of skill labels. These coarse skill labels look interpretable
    to humans.To validate that these skill labels are meaningful and relevant to the
    LLM's reasoning processes we perform the following experiments. (a) We ask GPT-4
    to assign skill labels to training questions in math datasets GSM8K and MATH.  (b)
    When using an LLM to solve the test questions, we present it with the full list
    of skill labels and ask it to identify the skill needed. Then it is presented
    with randomly selected exemplar solved questions associated with that skill label.  This
    improves accuracy on GSM8k and MATH for several strong LLMs, including code-assisted
    models. The methodology presented is domain-agnostic,  even though this article
    applies it to math problems.

  title: 'Metacognitive Capabilities of LLMs: An Exploration in Mathematical Problem
    Solving'
  topics:
  - name: Generative Models->In Context Learning
- abstract: Generative models hold great promise for small molecule discovery, significantly
    increasing the size of search space compared to traditional in silico screening
    libraries. However, most existing machine learning methods for small molecule
    generation suffer from poor synthesizability of candidate compounds, making experimental
    validation difficult. In this paper we propose Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension
    of the GFlowNet framework that operates directly in the space of chemical reactions,
    thereby allowing out-of-the-box synthesizability while maintaining comparable
    quality of generated candidates. We demonstrate that with the proposed set of
    reactions and building blocks, it is possible to obtain a search space of molecules
    orders of magnitude larger than existing screening libraries coupled with low
    cost of synthesis. We also show that the approach scales to very large fragment
    libraries, further increasing the number of potential molecules. We demonstrate
    the effectiveness of the proposed approach across a range of oracle models, including
    pretrained proxy models and GPU-accelerated docking.

  title: 'RGFN: Synthesizable Molecular Generation Using GFlowNets'
  topics:
  - name: Computational Biology
- abstract: Modeling stochastic and irregularly sampled time series is a challenging
    problem found in a wide range of applications, especially in medicine. Neural
    stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique
    for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with
    neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require
    backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and
    stability. To address this, we propose **Trajectory Flow Matching** (TFM), which
    trains a Neural SDE in a *simulation-free* manner, bypassing backpropagation through
    the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling
    to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for
    TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a reparameterization trick which
    improves training stability. Finally, we adapt TFM to the clinical time series
    setting, demonstrating improved performance on four clinical time series datasets
    both in terms of absolute performance and uncertainty prediction, a crucial parameter
    in this setting.
