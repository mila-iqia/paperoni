  paper:
    abstract: 'Deep learning models often fail to generalize well under distribution
      shifts. Understanding and overcoming these failures have led to a new research
      field on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization. Despite being extensively
      studied for static computer vision tasks, OOD generalization has been severely
      underexplored for time series tasks. To shine a light on this gap, we present
      WOODS: 10 challenging time series benchmarks covering a diverse range of data
      modalities, such as videos, brain recordings, and smart device sensory signals.
      We revise the existing OOD generalization algorithms for time series tasks and
      evaluate them using our systematic framework. Our experiments show a large room
      for improvement for empirical risk minimization and OOD generalization algorithms
      on our datasets, thus underscoring the new challenges posed by time series tasks.'
