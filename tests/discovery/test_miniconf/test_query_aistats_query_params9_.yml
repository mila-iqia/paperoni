- abstract: We present simulation-free score and flow matching ([SF]$^2$M), a simulation-free
    objective for inferring stochastic dynamics given unpaired samples drawn from
    arbitrary source and target distributions. Our method generalizes both the score-matching
    loss used in the training of diffusion models and the recently proposed flow matching
    loss used in the training of continuous normalizing flows. [SF]$^2$M interprets
    continuous-time stochastic generative modeling as a Schrödinger bridge problem.
    It relies on static entropy-regularized optimal transport, or a minibatch approximation,
    to efficiently learn the SB without simulating the learned stochastic process.
    We find that [SF]$^2$M is more efficient and gives more accurate solutions to
    the SB problem than simulation-based methods from prior work. Finally, we apply
    [SF]$^2$M to the problem of learning cell dynamics from snapshot data. Notably,
    [SF]$^2$M is the first method to accurately model cell dynamics in high dimensions
    and can recover known gene regulatory networks from simulated data. Our code is
    available in the TorchCFM package at \url{https://github.com/atong01/conditional-flow-matching}.
