abstract: We consider the problem of generating musical soundtracks in sync with rhythmic
  visual cues. Most existing works rely on pre-defined music representations, leading
  to the incompetence of generative flexibility and complexity. Other methods directly
  generating video-conditioned waveforms suffer from limited scenarios, short lengths,
  and unstable generation quality. To this end, we present Long-Term Rhythmic Video
  Soundtracker (LORIS), a novel framework to synthesize long-term conditional waveforms.
  Specifically, our framework consists of a latent conditional diffusion probabilistic
  model to perform waveform synthesis. Furthermore, a series of context-aware conditioning
  encoders are proposed to take temporal information into consideration for a long-term
  generation. Notably, we extend our model's applicability from dances to multiple
  sports scenarios such as floor exercise and figure skating. To perform comprehensive
  evaluations, we establish a benchmark for rhythmic video soundtracks including the
  pre-processed dataset, improved evaluation metrics, and robust generative baselines.
  Extensive experiments show that our model generates long-term soundtracks with state-of-the-art
  musical quality and rhythmic correspondence. Codes are available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LORIS.
