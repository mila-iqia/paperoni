abstract: 'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that are based on the message passing (MP)
  paradigm generally exchange information between 1-hop neighbors to build node representations
  at each layer. In principle, such networks are not able to capture long-range interactions
  (LRI) that may be desired or necessary for learning a given task on graphs. Recently,
  there has been an increasing interest in development of Transformer-based methods
  for graphs that can consider full node connectivity beyond the original sparse structure,
  thus enabling the modeling of LRI. However, MP-GNNs that simply rely on 1-hop message
  passing often fare better in several existing graph benchmarks when combined with
  positional feature representations, among other innovations, hence limiting the
  perceived utility and ranking of Transformer-like architectures. Here, we present
  the Long Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB) with 5 graph learning datasets: PascalVOC-SP,
  COCO-SP, PCQM-Contact, Peptides-func and Peptides-struct that arguably require LRI
  reasoning to achieve strong performance in a given task. We benchmark both baseline
  GNNs and Graph Transformer networks to verify that the models which capture long-range
  dependencies perform significantly better on these tasks. Therefore, these datasets
  are suitable for benchmarking and exploration of MP-GNNs and Graph Transformer architectures
  that are intended to capture LRI.'
