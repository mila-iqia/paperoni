abstract: The current mainstream software for peptide-centric tandem mass spectrometry
  data analysis can be categorized as either database-driven, which rely on a library
  of mass spectra to identify the peptide associated with novel query spectra, or
  de novo sequencing-based, which aim to find the entire peptide sequence by relying
  only on the query mass spectrum. While the first paradigm currently produces state-of-the-art
  results in peptide identification tasks, it does not inherently make use of information
  present in the query mass spectrum itself to refine identifications. Meanwhile,
  de novo approaches attempt to solve a complex problem in one go, without any search
  space constraints in the general case, leading to comparatively poor results. In
  this paper, we decompose the de novo problem into putatively easier subproblems,
  and we show that peptide identification rates of database-driven methods may be
  improved in terms of peptide identification rate by solving one such subsproblem
  without requiring a solution for the complete de novo task. We demonstrate this
  using a de novo peptide length prediction task as the chosen subproblem. As a first
  prototype, we show that a deep learning-based length prediction model increases
  peptide identification rates in the ProteomeTools dataset as part of an Pepid-based
  identification pipeline. Using the predicted information to better rank the candidates,
  we show that combining ideas from the two paradigms produces clear benefits in this
  setting. We propose that the next generation of peptide-centric tandem mass spectrometry
  identification methods should combine elements of these paradigms by mining facts
  “de novo; about the peptide represented in a spectrum, while simultaneously limiting
  the search space with a peptide candidates database.
