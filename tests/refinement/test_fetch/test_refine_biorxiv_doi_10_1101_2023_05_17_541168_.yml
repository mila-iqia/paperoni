abstract: In recent years, large-scale computational models of the cortex have emerged
  as a powerful way to study the multi-scale mechanisms of neural processing. However,
  due to computational costs and difficulty of parameterization, detailed biophysical
  reconstructions have so far been restricted to small volumes of tissue, where the
  study of macro- and meso-scale interactions that are central to cortical function
  is not possible. We describe here, and in a companion paper, an approach to address
  the scaling challenges and provide a model of multiple interacting cortical regions
  at a subcellular level of detail. The model consists of 4.2 million morphologically
  detailed neurons in 8 sub-regions and connected with 13.2 billion synapses through
  local and long-range connectivity. Its anatomical aspects are described in the companion
  paper; here, we introduce physiological models of neuronal activity and synaptic
  transmission that integrate a large number of literature sources and were built
  using previously published algorithms. Biological neuronal diversity was captured
  in 208 morpho-electrical neuron types, five types of synaptic short-term dynamics,
  and pathway-specificity of synaptic parameters. A representation of synaptic input
  from cortical regions not present in the model was added and efficiently calibrated
  to reference firing rates. The model exhibits a spectrum of dynamical states differing
  in the degree to which they are internally versus externally driven. We characterized
  which parts of the spectrum are compatible with available experimental data on layer-specific
  delays and amplitudes of responses to simple stimuli, and found an in vivo-like
  regime at the edge of a transition from asynchronous to synchronous spontaneous
  activity. We developed a rich set of simulation tools to recreate a diverse set
  of laboratory experiments in silico, providing further validation and demonstrating
  the utility of the model in a variety of paradigms. Finally, we found that the large
  spatial scale of the model, that incorporates multiple cortical regions, led to
  the emergence of multiple independent computational units interacting through long-range
  synaptic pathways. The model provides a framework for the continued integration
  of experimental findings, for challenging hypotheses and making testable predictions,
  and provides a foundation for further simulation-based studies of cortical processing
  and learning.
