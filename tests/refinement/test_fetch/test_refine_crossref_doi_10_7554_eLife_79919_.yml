abstract: "\n                    Cell size is controlled to be within a specific range\
  \ to support physiological function. To control their size, cells use diverse mechanisms\
  \ ranging from ‘sizers’, in which differences in cell size are compensated for in\
  \ a single cell division cycle, to ‘adders’, in which a constant amount of cell\
  \ growth occurs in each cell cycle. This diversity raises the question why a particular\
  \ cell would implement one rather than another mechanism? To address this question,\
  \ we performed a series of simulations evolving cell size control networks. The\
  \ size control mechanism that evolved was influenced by both cell cycle structure\
  \ and specific selection pressures. Moreover, evolved networks recapitulated known\
  \ size control properties of naturally occurring networks. If the mechanism is based\
  \ on a G1 size control and an S/G2/M timer, as found for budding yeast and some\
  \ human cells, adders likely evolve. But, if the G1 phase is significantly longer\
  \ than the S/G2/M phase, as is often the case in mammalian cells in vivo, sizers\
  \ become more likely. Sizers also evolve when the cell cycle structure is inverted\
  \ so that G1 is a timer, while S/G2/M performs size control, as is the case for\
  \ the fission yeast\n                    S. pombe\n                    . For some\
  \ size control networks, cell size consistently decreases in each cycle until a\
  \ burst of cell cycle inhibitor drives an extended G1 phase much like the cell division\
  \ cycle of the green algae\n                    Chlamydomonas\n                \
  \    . That these size control networks evolved such self-organized criticality\
  \ shows how the evolution of complex systems can drive the emergence of critical\
  \ processes.\n                  "
