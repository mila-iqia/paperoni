abstract: In terms of accuracy, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the best architectural
  choice for the node classification task. Their drawback in real-world deployment
  is the latency that emerges from the neighbourhood processing operation. One solution
  to the latency issue is to perform knowledge distillation from a trained GNN to
  a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), where the MLP processes only the features of the
  node being classified (and possibly some pre-computed structural information). However,
  the performance of such MLPs in both transductive and inductive settings remains
  inconsistent for existing knowledge distillation techniques. We propose to address
  the performance concerns by using a specially-designed student model instead of
  an MLP. Our model, named Routing-by-Memory (RbM), is a form of Mixture-of-Experts
  (MoE), with a design that enforces expert specialization. By encouraging each expert
  to specialize on a certain region on the hidden representation space, we demonstrate
  experimentally that it is possible to derive considerably more consistent performance
  across multiple datasets. Code available at https://github.com/Rufaim/routing-by-memory.
