abstract: The value of preclinical diffusion MRI (dMRI) is substantial. While dMRI
  enables in vivo non‐invasive characterization of tissue, ex vivo dMRI is increasingly
  being used to probe tissue microstructure and brain connectivity. Ex vivo dMRI has
  several experimental advantages including higher SNR and spatial resolution compared
  to in vivo studies, and enabling more advanced diffusion contrasts for improved
  microstructure and connectivity characterization. Another major advantage of ex
  vivo dMRI is the direct comparison with histological data, as a crucial methodological
  validation. However, there are a number of considerations that must be made when
  performing ex vivo experiments. The steps from tissue preparation, image acquisition
  and processing, and interpretation of results are complex, with many decisions that
  not only differ dramatically from in vivo imaging of small animals, but ultimately
  affect what questions can be answered using the data. This work represents “Part
  2” of a three‐part series of recommendations and considerations for preclinical
  dMRI. We describe best practices for dMRI of ex vivo tissue, with a focus on the
  value that ex vivo imaging adds to the field of dMRI and considerations in ex vivo
  image acquisition. We first give general considerations and foundational knowledge
  that must be considered when designing experiments. We briefly describe differences
  in specimens and models and discuss why some may be more or less appropriate for
  different studies. We then give guidelines for ex vivo protocols, including tissue
  fixation, sample preparation, and MR scanning. In each section, we attempt to provide
  guidelines and recommendations, but also highlight areas for which no guidelines
  exist (and why), and where future work should lie. An overarching goal herein is
  to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of ex vivo dMRI acquisitions and analyses,
  and thereby advance biomedical knowledge.
