abstract: 'Understanding inequalities in SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with the
  social determinants of health could help the development of effective mitigation
  strategies that are responsive to local transmission dynamics. This study aims to
  quantify social determinants of geographic concentration of SARS-CoV-2 cases across
  16 census metropolitan areas (hereafter, cities) in 4 Canadian provinces, British
  Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.


  We used surveillance data on confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and census data for social
  determinants at the level of the dissemination area (DA). We calculated Gini coefficients
  to determine the overall geographic heterogeneity of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2
  in each city, and calculated Gini covariance coefficients to determine each city’s
  heterogeneity by each social determinant (income, education, housing density and
  proportions of visible minorities, recent immigrants and essential workers). We
  visualized heterogeneity using Lorenz (concentration) curves.


  We observed geographic concentration of SARS-CoV-2 cases in cities, as half of the
  cumulative cases were concentrated in DAs containing 21%–35% of their population,
  with the greatest geographic heterogeneity in Ontario cities (Gini coefficients
  0.32–0.47), followed by British Columbia (0.23–0.36), Manitoba (0.32) and Quebec
  (0.28–0.37). Cases were disproportionately concentrated in areas with lower income
  and educational attainment, and in areas with a higher proportion of visible minorities,
  recent immigrants, high-density housing and essential workers. Although a consistent
  feature across cities was concentration by the proportion of visible minorities,
  the magnitude of concentration by social determinant varied across cities.


  Geographic concentration of SARS-CoV-2 cases was observed in all of the included
  cities, but the pattern by social determinants varied. Geographically prioritized
  allocation of resources and services should be tailored to the local drivers of
  inequalities in transmission in response to the resurgence of SARS-CoV-2.'
