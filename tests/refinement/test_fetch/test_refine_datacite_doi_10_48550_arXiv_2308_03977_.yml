abstract: 'Synthetic image datasets offer unmatched advantages for designing and evaluating
  deep neural networks: they make it possible to (i) render as many data samples as
  needed, (ii) precisely control each scene and yield granular ground truth labels
  (and captions), (iii) precisely control distribution shifts between training and
  testing to isolate variables of interest for sound experimentation. Despite such
  promise, the use of synthetic image data is still limited -- and often played down
  -- mainly due to their lack of realism. Most works therefore rely on datasets of
  real images, which have often been scraped from public images on the internet, and
  may have issues with regards to privacy, bias, and copyright, while offering little
  control over how objects precisely appear. In this work, we present a path to democratize
  the use of photorealistic synthetic data: we develop a new generation of interactive
  environments for representation learning research, that offer both controllability
  and realism. We use the Unreal Engine, a powerful game engine well known in the
  entertainment industry, to produce PUG (Photorealistic Unreal Graphics) environments
  and datasets for representation learning. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential
  of PUG to enable more rigorous evaluations of vision models.'
