abstract: '

  Epitope-based vaccines are promising therapeutic modalities for infectious diseases
  and cancer, but identifying immunogenic epitopes is challenging. The vast majority
  of prediction methods only use amino acid sequence information, and do not incorporate
  wide-scale structure data and biochemical properties across each peptide-MHC. We
  present ImmunoStruct, a deep-learning model that integrates sequence, structural,
  and biochemical information to predict multi-allele class-I peptide-MHC immunogenicity.
  By leveraging a multimodal dataset of ∼27,000 peptide-MHCs, we demonstrate that
  ImmunoStruct improves immunogenicity prediction performance and interpretability
  beyond existing methods, across infectious disease epitopes and cancer neoepitopes.
  We further show strong alignment with

  in vitro

  assay results for a set of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, as well as strong performance in
  peptide-MHC-based cancer patient survival prediction. Overall, this work also presents
  a new architecture that incorporates equivariant graph processing and multimodal
  data integration for the long standing task in immunotherapy.
