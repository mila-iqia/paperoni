abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) allows for predicting all the chemical and
  physical properties of molecular systems from first principles by finding an approximate
  solution to the many-body Schrödinger equation. However, the cost of these predictions
  becomes infeasible when increasing the scale of the energy evaluations, e.g., when
  calculating the ground-state energy for simulating molecular dynamics. Recent works
  have demonstrated that, for substantially large datasets of molecular conformations,
  Deep Learning-based models can predict the outputs of the classical DFT solvers
  by amortizing the corresponding optimization problems. In this paper, we propose
  a novel method that reduces the dependency of amortized DFT solvers on large pre-collected
  datasets by introducing a self-refining training strategy. Namely, we propose an
  efficient method that simultaneously trains a deep-learning model to predict the
  DFT outputs and samples molecular conformations that are used as training data for
  the model. We derive our method as a minimization of the variational upper bound
  on the KL-divergence measuring the discrepancy between the generated samples and
  the target Boltzmann distribution defined by the ground state energy. To demonstrate
  the utility of the proposed scheme, we perform an extensive empirical study comparing
  it with the models trained on the pre-collected datasets. Finally, we open-source
  our implementation of the proposed algorithm, optimized with asynchronous training
  and sampling stages, which enables simultaneous sampling and training. Code is available
