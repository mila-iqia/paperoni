abstract: With the rapid growth of the developer community, the amount of posts on
  online technical forums has been growing rapidly, which poses difficulties for users
  to filter useful posts and find important information. Tags provide a concise feature
  dimension for users to locate their interested posts and for search engines to index
  the most relevant posts according to the queries. However, most tags are only focused
  on the technical perspective (e.g., program language, platform, tool). In most cases,
  forum posts in online developer communities reveal the author's intentions to solve
  a problem, ask for advice, share information, etc. The modeling of the intentions
  of posts can provide an extra dimension to the current tag taxonomy. By referencing
  previous studies and learning from industrial perspectives, we create a refined
  taxonomy for the intentions of technical forum posts. Through manual labeling and
  analysis on a sampled post dataset extracted from online forums, we understand the
  relevance between the constitution of posts (code, error messages) and their intentions.
  Furthermore, inspired by our manual study, we design a pre-trained transformer-based
  model to automatically predict post intentions. The best variant of our intention
  prediction framework, which achieves a Micro F1-score of 0.589, Top 1-3 accuracy
  of 62.6% to 87.8%, and an average AUC of 0.787, outperforms the state-of-the-art
  baseline approach. Our characterization and automated classification of forum posts
  regarding their intentions may help forum maintainers or third-party tool developers
  improve the organization and retrieval of posts on technical forums. We have released
  our annotated dataset and codes in our supplementary material package.
