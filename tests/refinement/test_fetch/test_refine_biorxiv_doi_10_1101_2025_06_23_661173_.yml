abstract: The hippocampus has long been regarded as a neural map of physical space,
  with its neurons categorized as spatially or non-spatially tuned according to their
  response selectivity. However, growing evidence suggests that this dichotomy oversimplifies
  the complex roles hippocampal neurons play in integrating spatial and non-spatial
  information. Through computational modeling and in-vivo electrophysiology in macaques,
  we show that neurons classified as spatially tuned primarily encode linear combinations
  of immediate behaviorally relevant factors, while those labeled as non-spatially
  tuned rely on nonlinear mechanisms to integrate temporally distant experiences.
  Furthermore, our findings reveal a temporal gradient in the primate CA3 region,
  where spatial selectivity diminishes as neurons encode increasingly distant past
  events. Finally, using artificial neural networks, we demonstrate that nonlinear
  recurrent connections are crucial for capturing the response dynamics of non-spatially
  tuned neurons, particularly those encoding memory-related information. These findings
  challenge the traditional dichotomy of spatial versus non-spatial representations
  and instead suggest a continuum of linear and nonlinear computations that underpin
  hippocampal function. This framework provides new insights into how the hippocampus
  bridges perception and memory, informing on its role in episodic memory, spatial
  navigation, and associative learning.
