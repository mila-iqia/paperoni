abstract: Idioms are unlike most phrases in two important ways. First, the words in
  an idiom have non-canonical meanings. Second, the non-canonical meanings of words
  in an idiom are contingent on the presence of other words in the idiom. Linguistic
  theories differ on whether these properties depend on one another, as well as whether
  special theoretical machinery is needed to accommodate idioms. We define two measures
  that correspond to the properties above, and we implement them using BERT (Devlin
  et al., 2019) and XLNet(Yang et al., 2019). We show that idioms fall at the expected
  intersection of the two dimensions, but that the dimensions themselves are not correlated.
  Our results suggest that special machinery to handle idioms may not be warranted.
