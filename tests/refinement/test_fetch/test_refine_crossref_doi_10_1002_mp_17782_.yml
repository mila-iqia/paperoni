abstract: LimbusAI could not adapt well to pediatric anatomy for the esophagus and
  the kidneys. When commercial products do not suit the study population, the nnU‐Net
  is a viable option but requires adjustments. In resource‐constrained settings, the
  in‐house model provides an alternative. Implementing an automated segmentation tool
  requires careful monitoring and quality assurance regardless of the approach.
