abstract: Cultural transmission is the domain-general social skill that allows agents
  to acquire and use information from each other in real-time with high fidelity and
  recall. It can be thought of as the process that perpetuates fit variants in cultural
  evolution. In humans, cultural evolution has led to the accumulation and refinement
  of skills, tools and knowledge across generations. We provide a method for generating
  cultural transmission in artificially intelligent agents, in the form of few-shot
  imitation. Our agents succeed at real-time imitation of a human in novel contexts
  without using any pre-collected human data. We identify a surprisingly simple set
  of ingredients sufficient for generating cultural transmission and develop an evaluation
  methodology for rigorously assessing it. This paves the way for cultural evolution
  to play an algorithmic role in the development of artificial general intelligence.
