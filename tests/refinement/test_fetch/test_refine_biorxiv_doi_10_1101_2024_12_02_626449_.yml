abstract: Cell tracking in chimeric models is essential yet challenging, particularly
  in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and transplantation studies. Existing
  methods, such as fluorescent labeling and genetic barcoding, are technically demanding,
  costly, and often impractical for dynamic, heterogeneous tissues. To address these
  limitations, we propose a computational framework that leverages sex as a surrogate
  marker for cell tracking. Our approach uses a machine learning model trained on
  single-cell transcriptomic data to predict cell sex with high accuracy, enabling
  clear distinction between donor (male) and recipient (female) cells in sex-mismatched
  chimeric models. The model identifies specific genes critical for sex prediction
  and has been validated using public datasets and experimental flow sorting, confirming
  the biological relevance of the identified cell populations. Applied to skeletal
  muscle macrophages, our method revealed distinct transcriptional profiles associated
  with cellular origins. This pipeline offers a robust, cost-effective solution for
  cell tracking in chimeric models, advancing research in regenerative medicine and
  immunology by providing precise insights into cellular origins and therapeutic outcomes.
