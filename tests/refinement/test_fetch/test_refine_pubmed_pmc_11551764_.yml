abstract: 'Neurons are thought to act as parts of assemblies with strong internal
  excitatory connectivity. Conversely, inhibition is often reduced to blanket inhibition
  with no targeting specificity. We analyzed the structure of excitation and inhibition

  of cortical tissue. We found that excitation was structured around a feed-forward
  flow in large non-random neuron motifs with a structure of information flow from
  a small number of sources to a larger number of potential targets. Inhibitory neurons
  connected with neurons in specific sequential positions of these motifs, implementing
  targeted and symmetrical competition between them. None of these trends are detectable
  in only pairwise connectivity, demonstrating that inhibition is structured by these
  large motifs. While descriptions of inhibition in cortical circuits range from non-specific
  blanket-inhibition to targeted, our results describe a form of targeting specificity
  existing in the higher-order structure of the connectome. These findings have important
  implications for the role of inhibition in learning and synaptic plasticity.'
