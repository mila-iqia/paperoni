abstract: 'Understanding the mechanisms behind decisions taken by large foundation
  models in sequential decision making tasks is critical to ensuring that such systems
  operate transparently and safely. In this work, we perform exploratory analysis
  on the Video PreTraining (VPT) Minecraft playing agent, one of the largest open-source
  vision-based agents. We aim to illuminate its reasoning mechanisms by applying various
  interpretability techniques. First, we analyze the attention mechanism while the
  agent solves its training task - crafting a diamond pickaxe. The agent pays attention
  to the last four frames and several key-frames further back in its six-second memory.
  This is a possible mechanism for maintaining coherence in a task that takes 3-10
  minutes, despite the short memory span. Secondly, we perform various interventions,
  which help us uncover a worrying case of goal misgeneralization: VPT mistakenly
  identifies a villager wearing brown clothes as a tree trunk when the villager is
  positioned stationary under green tree leaves, and punches it to death.'
