abstract: An overwhelming majority of protein-protein interaction (PPI) studies are
  conducted in a select few model organisms largely due to constraints in time and
  cost of the associated “wet lab” experiments. In silico PPI inference methods are
  ideal tools to overcome these limitations, but often struggle with cross-species
  predictions. We present INTREPPPID, a method which incorporates orthology data using
  a new “quintuplet” neural network, which is constructed with five parallel encoders
  with shared parameters. INTREPPPID incorporates both a PPI classification task and
  an orthologous locality task. The latter learns embeddings of orthologues that have
  small Euclidean distances between them and large distances between embeddings of
  all other proteins. INTREPPPID outperforms all other leading PPI inference methods
  tested on both the intra-species and cross-species tasks using strict evaluation
  datasets. We show that INTREPPPID’s orthologous locality loss increases performance
  because of the biological relevance of the orthologue data, and not due to some
  other specious aspect of the architecture. Finally, we introduce PPI.bio and PPI
  Origami, a web server interface for INTREPPPID and a software tool for creating
  strict evaluation datasets, respectively. Together, these two initiatives aim to
  make both the use and development of PPI inference tools more accessible to the
  community.
