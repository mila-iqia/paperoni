abstract: "\n                The hippocampus has long been regarded as a neural map\
  \ of physical space, with its neurons categorized as spatially or non-spatially\
  \ tuned according to their response selectivity. However, growing evidence suggests\
  \ that this dichotomy oversimplifies the complex roles hippocampal neurons play\
  \ in integrating spatial and non-spatial information. Through computational modeling\
  \ and in-vivo electrophysiology in macaques, we show that neurons classified as\
  \ spatially tuned primarily encode linear combinations of immediate behaviorally\
  \ relevant factors, while those labeled as non-spatially tuned rely on nonlinear\
  \ mechanisms to integrate temporally distant experiences. Furthermore, our findings\
  \ reveal a temporal gradient in the primate CA3 region, where spatial selectivity\
  \ diminishes as neurons encode increasingly distant past events. Finally, using\
  \ artificial neural networks, we demonstrate that nonlinear recurrent connections\
  \ are crucial for capturing the response dynamics of non-spatially tuned neurons,\
  \ particularly those encoding memory-related information. These findings challenge\
  \ the traditional dichotomy of spatial versus non-spatial representations and instead\
  \ suggest a continuum of linear and nonlinear computations that underpin hippocampal\
  \ function. This framework provides new insights into how the hippocampus bridges\
  \ perception and memory, informing on its role in episodic memory, spatial navigation,\
  \ and associative learning."
