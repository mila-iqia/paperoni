abstract: Current efforts of modelling COVID-19 are often based on the standard compartmental
  models such as SEIR and their variations. As pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases
  can spread the disease between populations through travel, it is important to incorporate
  mobility between populations into the epidemiological modelling. In this work, we
  propose to modify the commonly-used SEIR model to account for the dynamic flight
  network, by estimating the imported cases based on the air traffic volume and the
  test positive rate. We conduct a case study based on data found in Canada to demonstrate
  how this modification, called Flight-SEIR, can potentially enable (1) early detection
  of outbreaks due to imported pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, (2) more accurate
  estimation of the reproduction number and (3) evaluation of the impact of travel
  restrictions and the implications of lifting these measures. The proposed Flight-SEIR
  is essential in navigating through this pandemic and the next ones, given how interconnected
  our world has become.
