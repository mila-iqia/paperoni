abstract: 'We present GraphMix, a regularization method for Graph Neural Network based
  semi-supervised object classification, whereby we propose to train a fully-connected
  network jointly with the graph neural network via parameter sharing and interpolation-based
  regularization. Further, we provide a theoretical analysis of how GraphMix improves
  the generalization bounds of the underlying graph neural network, without making
  any assumptions about the "aggregation" layer or the depth of the graph neural networks.
  We experimentally validate this analysis by applying GraphMix to various architectures
  such as Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks and Graph-U-Net.
  Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that GraphMix can consistently improve or
  closely match state-of-the-art performance using even simpler architectures such
  as Graph Convolutional Networks, across three established graph benchmarks: Cora,
  Citeseer and Pubmed citation network datasets, as well as three newly proposed datasets:
  Cora-Full, Co-author-CS and Co-author-Physics.'
