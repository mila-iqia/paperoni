abstract: Efficiently quantifying predictive uncertainty in medical images remains
  a challenge. While Bayesian neural networks (BNN) offer predictive uncertainty,
  they require substantial computational resources to train. Although Bayesian approximations
  such as ensembles have shown promise, they still suffer from high training and inference
  costs. Existing approaches mainly address the costs of BNN inference post-training,
  with little focus on improving training efficiency and reducing parameter complexity.
  This study introduces a training procedure for a sparse (partial) Bayesian network.
  Our method selectively assigns a subset of parameters as Bayesian by assessing their
  deterministic saliency through gradient sensitivity analysis. The resulting network
  combines deterministic and Bayesian parameters, exploiting the advantages of both
  representations to achieve high task-specific performance and minimize predictive
  uncertainty. Demonstrated on multi-label ChestMNIST for classification and ISIC,
  LIDC-IDRI for segmentation, our approach achieves competitive performance and predictive
  uncertainty estimation by reducing Bayesian parameters by over 95\%, significantly
  reducing computational expenses compared to fully Bayesian and ensemble methods.
