abstract: 'Data science approaches personalizing pediatric appendicitis management
  are hampered by small datasets and unstructured electronic medical records (EMR).
  Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots based on large language models (LLMs) can
  structure free-text EMR data. Here we compare data extraction quality between ChatGPT-4
  and human data collectors.


  To train AI models to grade pediatric appendicitis preoperatively, several data
  collectors (medical students and research assistants) extracted detailed preoperative
  and operative data from 2100 children operated for acute appendicitis between 2014-2021.
  Collectors were trained and certified for the task based on satisfactory Kappa scores.
  ChatGPT-4 was prompted to structure free text from 103 random anonymized ultrasound
  and operative records in the dataset using the set variables and coding options,
  and to estimate the Pediatric Appendicitis Grade (PAG) from the operative report.
  A pediatric surgeon then adjudicated all data, identifying errors in each method.


  Within the 44 ultrasound (42.7%) and 32 operative reports (31.1%) discordant in
  at least one field, 98% of the errors were found in the manual data extraction.
  The PAG was erroneously assigned manually in 29 patients (28.2%), and by ChatGPT-4
  in 3 (2.9%). Across datasets, the use of the AI chatbot was able to avoid misclassification
  in 59.2% of the records including both reports and extracted data approx. 100x faster
  than manually.


  An AI chatbot significantly outperformed manual data extraction in accuracy for
  ultrasound and operative reports, and correctly assigned the PAG score. While wider
  validation is required and data safety concerns must be fully addressed, these novel
  AI tools show significant promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of research
  data collection.
